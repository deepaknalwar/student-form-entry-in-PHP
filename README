This application does students personal form entry where we wish to user enter
his Name,Class,Hobbies,Address and we automatically generate his ID using MySQL 
function.
Here we used MySQl for Database contain "kn_proj" as database name and "student"
 is a table name having 5 fields.
When user enter his details & submit the form then at back end using php we store 
the record into database & using ajax we show the record on same page without 
reloading that page.

when we creating php file that file store in "www" folder.you should copy
this ajax1 folder within your wamp www folder, For database i was exported one SQL file which have
